                <p>I am currently a sophomore at OTC and enrolled in the associate transfer degree program for Computer Science
                with an emphasis on software development. I will have my associates degree in December of 2023 and plan on
                applying for an internship as a front end developer. After my associates, I will transfer to Missouri State University
                and complete my Bachelor's in Computer Science.</p>

                <p>After taking a gap year, I returned to OTC to pursue a career as an electrician. I made it through
                  half of the electrical program before I realized this was a career that I would not be happy with in the
                  long run. However, I learned a lot about myself and what makes me happy through this journey and there are
                  no regrets associated with this part of my education. </p>

                  I was a very active member in our school's DECA chapter. I was co-vice president of our chapter and
                  was even the general manager at our school's coffee shop my senior year. Go Tigers!</p>

                <p>At Loyd's Electrical Supply I am responsible for fulfilling orders for contractors
                  and keeping the warehouse tidy and in order. At Loyd's I have learned many organizational skills
                  that I believe will help me in any career moving forward. At Loyd's I personally implemented a new system
                  to keep track of partial cuts of wire that have saved the company thousands of dollars in the first year
                  of being implemented. </p>

                <p>At Millwood I am a bartender. This position has allowed me to create meaningful relationships with members
                  of the club. I have learned great networking skills through my time with the members. The bartending itself has
                  is extremely fast paced and allows very little room for error. I have excelled at this position and have made very
                  few mistakes which has kept our guests happy.</p>

                  This position was unlike anything I had ever done. The project we worked on gave me great experience in
