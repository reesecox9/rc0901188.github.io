          <h3>Rugs</h3>
          <img src="images/rugs.jpg" alt="rolled up rugs">
          <p class="interest">In my spare time I love to make rugs. I do this through a process called
          tufting. I use a projector to cast my image to my frame and trace the design.
          Then I use my tufting gun to add the yarn to the design and that is the foundation
          of the rugs I make. I have made accent rugs, wall decorations, character designs, and much more.
          This is my favorite way to express my creativity while capitalizing on my skill.</p>

          <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
          <img src="images/mindful.jpg" alt="Stacked Rocks">
          <p class="interest"> I believe the key to success is staying mindful of yourself and your surroundings.
            It is extremely important to understand how your own actions are affecting yourself
            and those surrounding you. I think it is easy for people to get too caught up in themselves
            without thinking about the repercussions of their own actions. This is why I try my best to give as much
            thought to my surroundings as I do to my own self. I hope that this leads to people trusting and
            counting on me to be their teammate.</p>

          <h3>Renewable Energy Techniques</h3>
          <img src="images/energy.jpg" alt="Windmills">
          <p class="interest">I am a huge geek when it comes to renewable energy. In the long run I would love to tie my
          computer science skills to renewable energy to implement better energy practices in tech. I believe we only have a
          matter of time before the use of fossil fuels destroys the earth and it is our duty to fix this issue.
         Feel free to ask about my ideas for a more efficient future!</p>
