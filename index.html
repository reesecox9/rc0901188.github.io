          <h1>Bio</h1>
          <p>&nbsp; My name is Reese Cox. I am a 22 year old college student pursuing a Bachelors in computer science at
          Ozark Technical Community College in Springfield, Mo. I am excited to explore all of the different
          career options that this degree will provide me with. </p>

          <p>&nbsp; I have many goals I wish to achieve when it comes to my career. I would like to one day work a remote job for one of the GAMAM
            companies. I wish to gain as many certificates and skills that I can during my career. I hope to one day be a full stack software
            engineer so I can be a malleable employee and be placed wherever I may be needed to most. As ambitious as it may sound,
            I am 100% confident that I will achieve this goal and I cannot wait to see what I am capable of.
          </p>

          <p>
            &nbsp; Although work is a major part of most people's lives, it is not the only thing I am focused on. I have a wonderful family and girlfriend that I
            enjoy spending time with. We enjoy traveling to see our favorite artists, going on hikes, and spending weekends at the lake. I have immense
            gratitude for everyone in my life and plan to spend as much time with them as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            &nbsp; I also have a love for crafts and personal projects. I own a small business where I make custom rugs. I have crafted a process that allows me to
            create almost anything that a client may want to showcase in their living space. I love the process and the room for creativity that this allows me.
            I am also quite the comic book geek so I love having an outlet for me to take my own spin on some of my favorite characters from the pages.
